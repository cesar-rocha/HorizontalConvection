## Dedalus
Direct Numerical Simulations of Horizontal Convection are performed with
[Dedalus](http://dedalus-project.org), a spectral framework in python. Dedalus
can be
[installed](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-the-dedalus-package)
with pip or conda. We ran a 77 simulations across different three different
systems: a MacPro laptop (8 cores), a Linux workstation (24 cores), and a
supercomputer at the Australian National University (up to 1000 cores).
